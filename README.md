# opengl_raycaster

My little opnegl rust project.
Isnt finnished, the textures are messed up, there isn't collision detection.
I get this weird effect when I am close to a wall where the top of the wall is not straight, no clue why, I used the cosine to fix the main warp everyone talks about but I have no clue what that is, any help is greatly appreciated :)
